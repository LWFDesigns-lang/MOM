# **POD Workflow SOP**

Months 1-3: Foundation Phase  
Etsy Primary Platform | LWF Designs & Touge Technicians | December 2025

# **1\. Overview**

This SOP covers the foundation phase of your POD business. The focus is singular: validate niches, create designs, build listings on Etsy, and establish repeatable workflows. Marketing expansion (TikTok content) begins in Months 4-6. Platform expansion (Amazon, TikTok Shop, eBay) begins in Months 7-12. This phase is about building your product foundation and learning what sells.  
Key Benchmark: Successful merchants average 67 listings before reaching first $1,000 GMV, typically achieved within 118-165 days. Top performers maintain 10+ weekly uploads.

## **Months 1-3 Goals**

| METRIC | TARGET |
| :---- | :---- |
| Niches validated | 3-5 niches with proven demand |
| Total listings | 50+ designs by end of Month 3 |
| Weekly upload cadence | 5-10 new designs per week |
| Portfolio split | 70% evergreen / 30% seasonal |
| Workflow templates | Established for design, mockup, and listing creation |
| Platform | Etsy only (recommended for beginners due to built-in traffic) |

## **What's NOT in This Phase**

* TikTok content creation (starts Month 4\)  
* Additional platforms: Amazon, TikTok Shop, eBay (starts Month 7\)  
* Paid advertising (starts after identifying winners)  
* Outsourcing design creation (scaling phase)  
* Sample ordering and real product photography (Month 4-6)

## **Why Etsy First**

* Built-in traffic: Design-conscious shoppers actively seeking unique items  
* POD-friendly since 2016: Seven major providers integrate directly  
* Learnable SEO: Master titles, tags, descriptions before adding platform complexity  
* Conversion rates: 1-3% average, top sellers achieve 4-5%+

# **2\. Prerequisites**

## **Etsy Seller Account**

Required documents and information:

* Full legal name, date of birth, home address  
* Government-issued ID  
* Tax identification (SSN, ITIN, or EIN)  
* Bank account for Etsy Payments  
* Valid credit/debit card for billing fees

Note: Sellers with $500+ annual sales must have taxpayer ID on file. 1099-K issued for $20,000+ gross sales AND 200+ transactions.

## **POD Provider: Printful**

Start with Printful for simplicity during foundation phase:

* Native Etsy integration (no middleware needed)  
* Industry-leading 0.24% reshipment rate  
* 2-5 day production \+ 3-7 day US delivery  
* 440+ products including apparel, home decor, accessories  
* 20% sample discount (1 order/month, up to 3 items) — save for Month 4

### **Connection Steps**

* Create Printful account at printful.com  
* Navigate: Dashboard \> Stores \> Add Store \> Etsy  
* Grant access when prompted by Etsy  
* Verify connection shows 'Connected' status

## **Etsy Production Partner Disclosure (REQUIRED)**

Failure to disclose can result in listing removal or account suspension.

1. Go to Shop Manager \> Settings \> Partners you work with  
2. Add Printful: business name, location (Charlotte, NC), description  
3. When creating listings: select 'Another company or person' under 'Who made it?'  
4. Choose 'Designed by a seller' (NOT 'Made by a seller')  
5. Assign Printful as production partner

June 2025 Update: Etsy now requires all items to be 'based on a seller's original design.' AI-generated content requires explicit disclosure in listings.

## **Tool Stack (Months 1-3)**

| TOOL | PURPOSE | COST |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Claude Pro | Planning, listing copy, research, workflow | $20/mo |
| MidJourney or DALL-E 3 | Design generation | $10-30/mo |
| eRank (free tier) | Etsy keyword research & competition | Free |
| Printful mockups | Product mockups (built into platform) | Free |
| Google Trends | Niche demand validation | Free |
| TOTAL |  | $30-50/mo |

## **Etsy Fee Structure**

| FEE TYPE | AMOUNT |
| :---- | :---- |
| Listing fee | $0.20 per item (renews every 4 months or upon sale) |
| Transaction fee | 6.5% of total sale (including shipping) |
| Payment processing | 3% \+ $0.25 per transaction (US sellers) |
| Offsite Ads (if attributed) | 15% on sales from Etsy ads (shops under $10K) |
| TOTAL (worst case with Offsite Ads) | \~22-25% of sale price |

Pricing formula: (POD Cost \+ Desired Profit) / 0.75 \= Minimum Retail Price  
Example: $12 POD cost \+ $8 profit \= $20 / 0.75 \= $26.67 minimum

# **3\. Step-by-Step Procedures**

## **Procedure 1: Niche Research & Validation**

Goal: Validate demand BEFORE designing. The validation sweet spot: consistent 12+ month demand, meaningful search volume, moderate competition (\<50K listings).

| TIME | OUTPUT | RISK | MITIGATION |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 15-30 min per niche | 3-5 validated niches | Analysis paralysis | Set 30-min timer; decide with available data |

1. Brainstorm niche ideas with Claude:

Prompt: "I'm launching POD brands: LWF Designs (broad appeal) and Touge Technicians (mountain automotive/car enthusiast). Suggest 10 specific niche ideas per brand that have passionate buyers and work on apparel and home decor. Avoid oversaturated niches like generic 'funny' or 'cat lover'. For each, note if evergreen or seasonal."

2. Validate macro demand with Google Trends:  
* Search your top 5 niche phrases  
* Look for CONSISTENT interest over 12+ months (not just spikes)  
* Compare related terms to find best angle  
* Check 'Related queries' for sub-niche opportunities  
3. Check Etsy competition with eRank:  
* Search your niche phrase directly on Etsy  
* Note total results count  
* Sweet spot: Meaningful searches \+ under 50K competing listings  
* Red flags: Millions of results, dominated by established sellers  
4. Document validated niches:  
* Niche name and target keywords  
* Google Trends assessment (stable/growing/declining)  
* Etsy competition level (low/medium/high)  
* Evergreen or seasonal designation  
* Brand assignment (LWF Designs or Touge Technicians)

Portfolio split: 70% evergreen niches (professions, hobbies, pets) and 30% seasonal. Seasonal lead time is 3 months minimum — Valentine's designs list by late December.

## **Procedure 2: AI Design Generation**

Goal: Generate print-ready design concepts. Build organized prompt libraries for efficiency.

| TIME | OUTPUT | RISK | MITIGATION |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 10-20 min per design | 3-5 design variations to select from | Poor prompt results | Use structured prompts; iterate systematically |

1. Select AI tool based on design type:  
* Text-heavy designs (quotes, typography): DALL-E 3  
* Artistic/stylized designs: MidJourney  
* Seamless patterns: Leonardo.ai (native tiling feature)  
2. Use structured prompt format:

Template: "\[style\] design featuring \[subject\], \[2-3 specific attributes\], isolated on white background, t-shirt design, high contrast, no background texture"  
Example: "Watercolor style design featuring a mountain pass with drift car, JDM aesthetic, Japanese text accents, isolated on white background, t-shirt design, high contrast"

3. Generate 3-5 variations per concept.  
4. Save to organized folder structure:

/Designs/\[Brand\]/\[Niche\]/\[Date\]-\[DesignName\]-v\[\#\].png  
Legal reality: Pure AI-generated outputs cannot be copyrighted under current US Copyright Office guidance. Add human modifications (layout changes, custom text, illustration refinements) to establish protection.

## **Procedure 3: Design File Preparation**

Goal: Transform AI outputs into production-ready files meeting POD specifications.

| TIME | OUTPUT | RISK | MITIGATION |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 10-15 min per design | Print-ready PNG file | Low resolution / wrong format | Use pre-flight checklist every time |

1. Verify resolution: 300 DPI minimum  
* T-shirts: 4500 x 5400 pixels typical  
* Mugs (11oz): 2475 x 1125 pixels  
* Use upscaling if needed (Printful has built-in upscaler)  
2. Remove background completely:  
* PNG format with TRUE transparency  
* Not white background — transparent  
* Check for artifacts around edges  
3. Verify color profile: sRGB IEC61966-2.1  
* NOT CMYK — POD printers optimize for RGB input  
* Avoid neon colors that won't reproduce accurately  
4. Add human modifications for copyright protection.  
5. Export and name correctly:  
* Format: PNG with transparency  
* Max file size: 200 MB (Printful)  
* Naming: \[Brand\]-\[Niche\]-\[ProductType\]-\[Version\].png

### **Pre-Flight Checklist**

| CHECK ITEM | PASS? |
| :---- | :---- |
| Resolution: 300 DPI minimum |  |
| Color profile: sRGB |  |
| Format: PNG with transparency |  |
| Background: Fully transparent (no white/gray) |  |
| File size: Under 200MB |  |
| No neon colors |  |
| Human modifications added |  |
| Text legible at print size |  |
| Design within safe zone |  |
| File named correctly |  |

## **Procedure 4: Mockup Generation**

Goal: Create lifestyle mockups that convert. Lifestyle images outperform flat-lay presentations.

| TIME | OUTPUT | RISK | MITIGATION |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 5-10 min per product | 5-7 images per listing | Generic mockups | Use lifestyle shots; vary angles |

1. Upload design to Printful's mockup generator.  
2. Generate 5-7 images per listing:  
* Primary: Lifestyle shot (model wearing/using product)  
* Secondary: Clean product shot on neutral background  
* Detail: Close-up showing print quality  
* Scale: Product with size reference  
* Variations: Different colors if offering multiple  
3. First image must 'stop the scroll' — invest in best lifestyle mockup.  
4. Save mockups with consistent naming:

\[SKU\]-\[ImageNumber\]-\[Type\].jpg

## **Procedure 5: Etsy Listing Creation**

Goal: Publish optimized listings with proper SEO and compliance.

| TIME | OUTPUT | RISK | MITIGATION |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 15-20 min per listing | Live, optimized Etsy listing | Policy violations / poor SEO | Use Claude for copy; follow compliance checklist |

1. Generate listing copy with Claude:

Prompt: "Create an Etsy listing for a \[product type\] with this design: \[description\]. Target niche: \[niche\]. I need: (1) Title under 62 characters, leading with product type and primary keyword; (2) 13 long-tail tags (no single words); (3) Description 300+ words with keywords naturally integrated. Follow Etsy SEO best practices."

2. Create product in Printful:  
* Select product type(s) for this design  
* Upload design and position correctly using preview  
* Set retail price using formula: (POD cost \+ profit) / 0.75  
3. Push to Etsy via Printful integration.  
4. Optimize listing in Etsy:  
* Verify title: Under 62 chars, lead with product type \+ primary keyword  
* Add all 13 tags: Long-tail phrases, mix broad and specific  
* Complete description: 300+ words, keywords in first paragraph  
* Set all attributes (color, material, occasion, etc.)  
* Upload 5-7 mockup images  
5. Complete compliance requirements:  
* Select production partner (Printful)  
* Choose 'Designed by a seller'  
* Disclose AI assistance if applicable

### **Etsy SEO Quick Reference**

| ELEMENT | BEST PRACTICE |
| :---- | :---- |
| Title | 48-62 chars; lead with product type \+ primary keyword |
| Tags | All 13 slots; long-tail phrases; no single words |
| Description | Keywords in first paragraph; 300+ words; indexed since May 2022 |
| Attributes | Complete ALL available attributes |
| Images | 5-7 images; lifestyle first; high quality |
| Refresh cycle | Update listings every 3-6 months (lose \~3% ranking/month) |

August 2025 Update: Etsy penalizes keyword-stuffed titles. Lead with product type, include key traits, move subjective descriptors to tags.

# **4\. Weekly Schedule Template**

Target: 5-10 new listings per week. This schedule assumes 8-12 hours weekly commitment.

## **Option A: Weeknight Sessions (1-2 hours each)**

| DAY | FOCUS | OUTPUT |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Monday | Niche research & design planning | Week's design brief |
| Tuesday | AI design generation | 5-10 raw designs |
| Wednesday | File preparation & mockups | Print-ready files \+ mockups |
| Thursday | Listing creation (Etsy) | 5-10 live listings |
| Friday | Review & optimize existing listings | Refreshed listings |

## **Option B: Weekend Batch (4-6 hours)**

| SESSION | TASKS |
| :---- | :---- |
| Saturday AM (3 hrs) | Niche research, design generation, file preparation |
| Saturday PM (2 hrs) | Mockups and listing creation |
| Sunday (1 hr) | Publish remaining listings, review week's work |

The batch approach (creating designs in sessions of 10-20, then staggering uploads) is recommended by successful sellers for maintaining consistent visibility in Etsy's algorithm.
